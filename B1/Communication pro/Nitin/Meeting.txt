In my opinion the best method is to copy all the papers 
to the numericall data thanks to our software and then with the agrement of the company
we should throw away all the old papers.
This method will take some times but the company will 
be happy to have to have all their old data safe and close to hand 
and to regain the place they had dedicated to the stockage of there papers.
This method will favored safety of the entreprise, if one day they 
we'll need an old file for one of their client or just to keep the 
data of the employees like their sick days, their vacations...
we'll be easier for them to find them
And if one day there company has a problem like a fire, flood or a 
burglary their data will be safe because we will have a copy of their files.
